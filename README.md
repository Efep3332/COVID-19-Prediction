# COVID-19-Prediction
Data-driven methods, such as MLR and ANN, were used to predict COVID-19 cases in Israel based on related independent variables 
MATLAB 9.3 (R2019A) was used in the process of developing the model that was used in the construction of the ANN model. 
To predict cases of COVID-19 in Israel, R-programming software 2017 and Excel were used to run correlation analyses
